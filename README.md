# Learning-and-Decision-Making
• Simulating well-known classical conditioning paradigms (e.g. Extinction, Blocking,
Oevrshadow, etc.) using simple Rescorla-Wagner rule. Then, using Kalman filter to
add known and unknown uncertainty to the model in order to support more paradigms.

• Simulation of a rat surviving in a water maze using Q-learning and TD(λ) rule.

• Implementing the drift diffusion model to simulate decision making paradigms and
another model explaining the interaction between MT and LIP.
